    "Due to high cost of living, Melbourne housing can be a nightmare for most. Melbourne is currently experiencing a housing bubble (some experts say it may burst soon). A potential client aspiring to buy a suitable property would like to become knowledgeable about the ongoing pricing to make a conscious decision. Furthermore, he/she would like to consider several factors like proximity to schools, medical care, restuarants, other liesure amenities to accomodate needs.\n",

    "With Melbourne housing market data coupled with data science techniques, one can derive useful insights and information about current pricing in different suburbs of Melbourne while considering other factors of his/her choice. This would help to make an informed decision about owning a property in a suitable location in Melbourne."
